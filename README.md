# Customer_behavior_analysis
In this Project, We created the webapp using streamlit which will deliver the KPI's, basic Dashboard and Marketing optimization strategy.
## Data description
CustomerID: Unique id for each customer.  
VisitDate: Dates on which customer made a purchase.  
TotalSpend: Total amount spend by the customer.  
ProductCategory: Product Category.  
We created a Dummy dataset of 1000 rows using Faker and used this data to create a dashboad.


## How to Use the app
* step 1 : To clone the repository 'git clone repository-https://github.com/piyush02nir/Customer_behavior_analysis'
* step 2 : create an environment (streamlit) and install all packages from requirement.txt
* step3 : Open terminal and write command 'streamlit run app.py'
* After step3 a streamlit dashboard will open where you have two options: 1. Upload Custom dataset or 2. Use Default Dataset.
* If you choose option 1, you will get the option to upload your dataset. (make sure your dataset have same feature name)
* If you choose 2 options, the dashboards with kpi's will be shown.
* And At the end, you have to choose at what spending category you belong to and based on that you will get suitable discounts.
